# C - Binary trees

## Tasks

* **[0. New node](./0-binary_tree_node.c):** C function that creates a binary tree node with a given parent and value.
	* Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.

* **[1. Insert left](./1-binary_tree_insert):** C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.
  * If the given `parent` already contains a left node, the new node takes its place and the old left-child becomes the left-child of the new node.

* **[2. Insert right](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c):** C function that inserts a node as the right-child of another.
  * Returns a pointer to the new node, or `NULL` on failure.
  * If the given `parent` already contains a right node, the new node takes its
  place and the old right-child becomes the right-child of the new node.

* **[3. Delete](./3-binary_tree_delete.c):** C function that deletes an entire binary tree.

* **4. Is leaf(./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c):** C function that checks
  if a given node is a leaf.
  * Returns `1` if the node is a leaf, `0` otherwise.

* **5. Is root(./5-binary_tree_is_root.c):** C function that checks
  if a given node is a root.
  * Returns `1` if the node is a root, `0` otherwise.

* **6. Pre-order traversal (./6-binary_tree_preorder.c):** C function that
  traverses a tree using pre-order traversal.

* **7. In-order traversal(./7-binary_tree_inorder.c):** C function that
  traverses a tree using in-order traversal.
